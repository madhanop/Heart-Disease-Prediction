# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models are trained and predictions are made with different algorithms. They are:

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (Linear)
LightGBM Classifier
I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.
